View and rotate multi-dimensional objects!

You will need to install the numpy package in order to run this program.

There are sliders that allow you to rotate the object you are viewing.
Note the large number of sliders for higher dimensions are due to the many ways a high-dimensional object can be rotated!

You have a choice of three classes of object:
- Cube: the most familiar. Includes the square, the cube, and their higher dimensional analogues
- Cross: dual to the cube. Higher dimensional analogues of the octahedron
- Simplex: a minimal shape. Includes the triangle, the tetrahedron, and their higher dimensional analogues
